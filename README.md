🇮🇹 My name is Luca Florio, and I am a Software Engineer from Italy.  
👔 I am currently working remotely at [Pleo](https://www.pleo.io/en/) as a Software Engineer on the Data Platform.  
🎓 I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science with a thesis on Self-Adaptive Decentralised Systems.  
📚 I am a passionate engineer that loves Distributed Systems ❤️.  
🤓 Right now, I am studying CRDTs.  
📝 When I feel inspired I write some articles for [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/elleflorio/) and my personal [blog](https://www.florio.dev/).

I am a passionate engineer, always ready to face new challenges. I would define myself as an "all-rounder" with solid computer science foundations and able to quickly adapt to any tech stack. I am a team player that loves to discuss ideas with teammates and help them reach their goals.
I love to learn new technologies and play with them to build toy projects that I share here on GitHub (as well as write articles for my blog and freeCodeCamp).

I value work/life balance, and in my free time I like to keep myself busy with several hobbies: I am a Krav Maga black belt :martial_arts_uniform:, an MMA padawan :boxing_glove:, an amateur [photographer](https://unsplash.com/@elleflorio) :camera:, and a salsa dancer :man_dancing:.  
All these activities help me keep a creative mind and “think outside the box” during my work. :unicorn:

:scroll: My favourite quote is: “The world is changed by your example, not by your opinion.” - Paulo Coelho
