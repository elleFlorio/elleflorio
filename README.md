🇮🇹 My name is Luca Florio, and I am a Software Engineer from Italy.  
👔 I am currently working remotely at Spotify as a Software Engineer.  
🎓 I hold a PhD in Computer Science with a thesis on Self-Adaptive Decentralised Systems.  
📚 I am a passionate engineer that loves Distributed Systems ❤️.  
🤓 Right now, I am reading "Software Architecture: The Hard Parts" and "The Making of a Manager"  
📝 When I feel inspired I write a post for my [blog](https://www.florio.dev/).  

I am a passionate engineer, always ready to face new challenges. I would define myself as an "all-rounder" with solid computer science foundations and able to quickly adapt to any tech stack. I am a team player that loves to discuss ideas with teammates and help them reach their goals.
I love to learn new technologies and play with them to build toy projects that I share on GitHub (as well as write articles for my blog).

I value work/life balance, and in my free time I like to keep myself busy with several hobbies: I love Crossfit 🏋️‍♂️, I am an amateur photographer 📷, and I used to dance salsa 🕺.
All these activities help me keep a creative mind and “think outside the box” during my work. 🦄

📜 My favourite quote is: “The world is changed by your example, not by your opinion.” - Paulo Coelho
