### Ciao! üëã

:it: My name is Luca Florio, and I am a Software Engineer from Italy.  
:necktie: I am currently working remotely at [Pleo](https://www.pleo.io/en/), where I play the role of the Data Engineer.  
:mortar_board: I hold a PhD in Computer Science about Self-Adaptive Decentralised Systems.   
:books: I like to tinker with Distributed Systems, and I :heart: functional programming.  
:nerd_face: Right now, I am studying CRDTs.  
:pencil: When I feel inspired I write some articles for [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/elleflorio/) and my personal [blog](https://www.florio.dev/).

I value work/life balance, and in my free time I like to keep myself busy with several hobbies: I am a Krav Maga black belt :martial_arts_uniform:, an MMA padawan :boxing_glove:, an amateur [photographer](https://unsplash.com/@elleflorio) :camera:, and a salsa dancer :man_dancing:.  
All these activities help me keep a creative mind and ‚Äúthink outside the box‚Äù during my work. :unicorn:

:scroll: My favourite quote is: ‚ÄúThe world is changed by your example, not by your opinion.‚Äù - Paulo Coelho
